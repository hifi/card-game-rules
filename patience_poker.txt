HAND 	    | UK  |  US  | Barry
------------|-----|------|-----
pair 	    |  1  |   2  |    2
2-pair 	    |  3  |   5  |    5
flush 	    |  5  |  20  |   15
3-of-a-kind |  6  |  10  |   10
straight    | 12  |  15  |   25
full house  | 10  |  50  |   50
4-of-a-kind | 16  |  70  |   70
str8 flush  | 30  | 100  |  100

===NOTE===
if it isn't obv, you don't score a thing twice i.e. a [full house] isn't
also scored as a [pair] + [3-of-a-kind]

===NOTE===
multiplayer is simply each person having their own deck and finding the same
card as the leader (guess you could rotate this?) and places it as they wish
on their board

===NOTE===
shackleton 'n boys played hella patience poker. the game was likely designed
around their adventure era (1909 is first mention in a publication)
