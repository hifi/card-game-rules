1. start with a shuffled deck of 52 cards and place the top card in the _center_
2. blindly deal another card and place it orthogonally next to the first card
3. continue this process, always placing the next card orthogonally next to any card
4. stop when you've filled all 5x5 slots

5. score each column/row by any system. UK is the OG method

HAND 	    | UK  |  US  | Barry
------------|-----|------|-----
pair 	    |  1  |   2  |    2
2-pair 	    |  3  |   5  |    5
flush 	    |  5  |  20  |   15
3-of-a-kind |  6  |  10  |   10
straight    | 12  |  15  |   25
full house  | 10  |  50  |   50
4-of-a-kind | 16  |  70  |   70
str8 flush  | 30  | 100  |  100

===NOTE===
if it isn't obv, you don't score a thing twice i.e. a [full house] isn't
also scored as a [pair] + [3-of-a-kind]

===NOTE===
multiplayer is simply each person having their own deck and finding the same
card as the leader and placing it as they wish on their board. i assume one
person stays dealer for the round so the others can have their cards sorted.

===NOTE===
shackleton 'n boys played hella patience poker in the arctic

===NOTE===
if you notice that the flush is worth more in some systems, that's bc it is
undervalued in the UK method, as 3-of-a-kind is easier to pull off
